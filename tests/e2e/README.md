E2E tests should be placed here (Playwright / Cypress). Example structure:

- tests/e2e/specs/            # E2E specs
- tests/e2e/fixtures/         # test fixtures

This project doesn't include a configured E2E runner by default. Install Playwright or Cypress and add scripts to `package.json` to run these tests.
